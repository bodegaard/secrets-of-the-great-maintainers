#### Description

Maintaining an open source project means you're often coding less and supporting contributors moreâ€”and taking on a set of tasks that maintainers rarely plan for. For some, this leads to burnout rather than thriving projects.

This workshop brings you experienced project maintainers who are ready to discuss the documentation, processes, and hard questions that need to be answered when preparing a project. Most importantly, you'll learn how to create a healthy community that helps move your project forward while safeguarding your sanity.
